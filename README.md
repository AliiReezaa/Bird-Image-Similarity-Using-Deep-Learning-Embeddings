# Bird-Image-Similarity-Using-Deep-Learning-Embeddings
This project demonstrates how to compute and analyze the similarity between bird images using deep learning models. It leverages pre-trained neural networks to extract embeddings and compares these embeddings to find similar images. The code is implemented in Python using PyTorch and includes dataset preparation from Kaggle.
